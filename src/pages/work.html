            <p>Existing design of a library website page curated by the library staff had issues that prevented users from understanding and enjoying the feature. I have completed a round of improvements and re-designs.</p>

            <p><small>Completed January 2020</small></p>
            <p>There was an opportunity to provide more useful information to new library users starting to do research for the first time. My solution was to design a new feature to help students get started with library tools.</p>

            <p>Wayfinding for the library users has consistently been a challenge. I worked on a team to solve key issues by completely re-designing the old map and improving wayfinding experience for the library patrons.</p>

            <p>Users complained that they coudn't find what they want. Finding information about library services was essential to the success of the website, so the team set out to re-design the library website global menu.</p>
