                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Through past survey I learned that new users would like help learning how to use the library website research features. The website did not provide robust help options on the homepage, so there was a need and an opportunity.</p>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This project was done for a large academic library. The library serves three academic institutions consisting of 43,000 students, staff, and faculty. The library website provides resources to aid students in doing their classwork and research.</p>

I was in charge of creating two interactive prototypes, recruiting for, designing, and carrying out usability research activities, and making design decisions based on the data gathered during research. I also refined and developed prototypes for production, communicated project progress to the stakeholders, and created and adhered to a timeframe. I was assisted by two team members.</p>

              <h2>The Original Design</h2>
              <p>The original design featured a "tooltip" containing minimal information about library research tools on the homepage. During the user testing I quickly learned that students do not pay attention to this "tooltip" and generally ignore it. While it was better than nothing, it did not offer any clear benefit to the user, as the information contained inside the "tooltip" simply repeated what was already included in the search tool placeholder text.</p>
              <p>There was an opportunity to provide more useful information to new library users starting to do research for the first time on the library website.</p>

              <p>During the process of creating prototypes for improving the homepage "tooltip", I have researched existing UI patterns for onboarding and help features. The aim of this research was to use UI patterns that users are familiar with and re-use existing design ideas to be more efficient.</p>

              <h2>Testing Prototypes</h2>
              <p>I wanted to learn more about how students would react to two interfaces offering help for research tools on the page and observe their preference. I designed two interactive prototypes and tested them with 25 students. The result was that students preferred the Prototype A, however they liked elements from both prototypes and I worked on incorporating these ideas on the next iteration for user testing and focus group with staff.</p>

              <p>While going through the research and design process, it was imperative that I seek the help of staff to learn more about their existing teaching practices and incorporate them into the design of the Help Feature. <!--I also needed to get "buy in" of the new prototypes and seek staff suggestions in what type of help content could go into the Help feature.--></p>
              <p>I planned, designed, and conducted a focus group with staff members. It included a guided Q&A, a demo of two prototypes, a discussion, and a collaborative journey mapping exercise. As a result of this focus group, I received valuable feedback for the language to be used, staff preferences to be included into the Help Feature, and a "buy in" from a critical group of stakeholders.</p>

              <p>After user testing with students, I noticed that they liked elements from both designs, so I designed an iteration of the original concept to explore an option where the two are combined. The next phase of testing showed that this alternative design was too long, and the students abandoned the interaction before reaching the end of it. Also users preferred the more familiar pattern.</p>
