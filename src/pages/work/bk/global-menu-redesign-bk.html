                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>The old global menu was cumbersome to browse and unorganized. The users were complaining of not finding what they wanted, and the key content was buried in the intermediate landing pages.</p>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This project was done for a large academic library. The library serves three academic institutions consisting of 43,000 students, staff, and faculty. The library website provides resources to aid students in doing their classwork and research.</p>

My contribution consisted of developing design and interactive prototype of the early menu idea, leading a Focus Group with staff, conducting User Testing, creating high fidelity mockups using Adobe Illustrator, and testing the final feature across browsers and devices.</p>

              <h2>The Original Design</h2>
              <p>In a previous survey we have received user complaints that the menus were too long and too cumbersome to browse through. The menus featured a lengthly dropdown design with a “More Options” catch all link at the end. Those “More Options” links led to landing pages which contained more links. Users had difficulty finding the pages that they needed and there were just too many clicks to get to where they needed.</p>
              <p>Finding information about library services was essential to the success of the website, so we identified the global menu as a potential feature we could re-design to improve the user experience.</p>

              <h2>Focus Group with Staff</h2>
              <p>From previous surveys we knew that our website navigation needed work, so we began an exploration process where we showed early ideas to a group of students and staff. I assisted in designing and led a focus group with staff users. Another team member conducted a focus group with student users. The staff focus group session included interviews, interactive prototype demo, card sorting, and page priority exercises.</p>

              <p>I worked on creating the look and functionality of Prototype “A” for user testing with students and staff. Prototype “B” was created by Lead Developer and included features that were later added to Prototype “A”. Prototype “A” featured:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bright orange menu button to catch user’s attention</li>
                <li>A “fly down” menu animation</li>
                <li>A two-tier design with a darker section</li>

              <h2>5 Minute User Testing</h2>
              <p>When we had our two prototypes ready, we designed and carried out user testing with the student population (20+ users). One of the constraints was that the students were always on the go, so I looked for a research method that would be quick and get to the point of what we needed to learn. The method for this user testing session was inspired by Zoe Chao’s presentation at Lita Forum - <a href="https://forum.lita.org/2017/sessions/designing-5-minute-ux-studies/">"Designing 5-minute UX Studies"</a> and it worked very well for our student population. Students were able to quickly test our prototypes and answer a few questions between classes.</p>

              <p>After the user testing I worked on high fidelity mockups of the menu using Adobe Illustrator. Because the users liked some elements from Prototype “B”, the team decided to make adjustments to Prototype “A” :</p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We increased the line spacing between text, because the users found it too “crowded” and “busy”.</li>
                  <li>We adding icons to categories because users preferred a more visual design.</li>
                  <li>We removed the "dark section" because users did not notice that it belonged to the menu.</li>

              <h2>Sketches and Design Variations</h2>
              <p>One of the features the students really liked during the user testing was icons. So, we worked on designing icons to best represent and communicate categories of the menu. Some icons were a custom design and some were taken from Zurb Foundation Framework. I used sketching to brainstorm ideas for the custom icons and went through a process with the team to discuss which worked best for the categories.</p>
              <p>I also completed the “Ask Us” cluster feature after several rounds of team discussion. I came up with several variations for what it could look like, making sure it fit into the amount of space that we had.</p>

              <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
              <p>One of the things that I have learned during and after completing this project, is that a design is never complete and new feedback may uncover new issues or approve/disprove hypotheses. For example, having run the Google Analytics click tracking for 1 year, we have noticed that some sections of the menu do not get used in spite of the fact that during the user testing, users preferred a more comprehensive design. After recent user interviews with students, we have also received feedback that the “In the Know” category icon does not communicate well what it contains. The future iterations of the menu (which may include unused link clean up) should address these problems!</p>
