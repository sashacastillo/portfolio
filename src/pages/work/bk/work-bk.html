            <p>The library website did not provide robust help options on the homepage, so there was an opportunity to provide more useful information to new library users starting to do research for the first time. My solution was to design a new feature to help students get started with library tools.</p>

            <p>Way-finding for the library users has consistently been a challenge and it was difficult for the users to complete key tasks using the existing library map. We solved key issues by completely re-designing the old map and improved way-finding experience for library patrons.</p>

            <p>Users complained that the menus were too long and too cumbersome to browse through. Finding information about library services was essential to the success of the website, so we set out to re-design the library website global menu to help users find what they want.</p>

            <p>Telling my story of transitioning from UI Development to UX Design was going to be a challenge. I approached it like I would any UX problem.
