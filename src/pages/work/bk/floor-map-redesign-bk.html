                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Through past user surveys the team has learned that way-finding for the library users has consistently been a challenge and it was difficult for the users to complete key tasks using the existing library map.</p>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This project was done for a large academic library. The library serves three academic institutions consisting of 43,000 students, staff, and faculty. The library website provides resources to aid students in doing their classwork and research.</p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p class="text-bottom">This project’s primary aim was to design and develop an interactive library floor map. I worked on some visual elements of the interactive map and the downloadable PDF version of the map available as an option for print. I worked on a team of three people and contributed to researching the patterns of interactive maps, working out visual design of the map, conducting a "pop up user testing" of the interactive map prototype, carrying out an “open house” event with library staff, creating storyboards, and making the PDF map accessible for screen readers.</p>

              <h2>Learning from Successful Map Designs</h2>
              <p>In the beginning of the project the team looked at examples of maps around the web (mostly art galleries and museums) to get ideas for the elements to incorporate into our new map design. We wanted to learn how other maps deal with the following: displaying non-public space, providing information without overwhelming the user with too much detail, and creating a visual style to match their website aesthetic. We also noted commonly used icon designs, entrance/doorway design, and elevator/stairs design. As a team we did exercises where we observed what we liked and did not like about each design.</p>

              <h2>Solving Problems</h2>
              <p>In the old map design we have identified the following problems: book stacks were not labeled, it wasn’t clear that the office areas are inaccessible to patrons, individual group study room numbers were not labelled, and it wasn’t clear what amenities the library had to offer. The team collectively worked out the visual design of the new map to solve these problems. I worked on the icons, office areas, legend, stacks, and the visual style of the map.</p>

              <p>How do I display book stacks without overwhelming users with too much detail? After researching how other libraries display stacks on their maps, I opted out for providing visual clues to help users locate books without making the map look too busy:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The stacks are divided into sections to help users identify the general area where the book is located.</li>
                <li>Each book stack is marked on the map to help users to count the stacks as they move around the floor.</li>
                <li>The users who are familiar with how to use call numbers can get oriented using the alphabetical order.</li>

The user testing also helped to inform my PDF version and helped identify issues with the design before they went into production.</p>
              <p>The team has collectively has identified three user pain points. We used the pain points to design the user tasks for testing the interactive map prototype:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pain point #1</strong>: finding a book</li>
                <li><strong>Pain point #2</strong>: finding a study room</li>

The aim was to demonstrate the three way-finding user pain points that we have identified as a team and wanted to solve with the new map design. The staff were then guided through three tasks using our new prototype that showed how we solved the problems of the old map design.</p>

I wanted to use a fully rendered style of artwork for the final product, but after discussing it with the project lead, I understood that a simpler style would be able to communicate what we needed, and would work better for our timeframe.</p>

              <p>I planned, designed, and conducted a focus group with 9 staff. It included a guided Q&A, a demo of two prototypes, discussion, and a collaborative journey mapping exercise. As a result I received valuable feedback for the language to be used, staff preferences what to include in the feature, and a "buy in" from a critical group of stakeholders.</p>

Ultimately, even though I myself liked the concept, the next phase of testing showed that it was too long and students will abandon the help feature before reaching the end of it. I also decided to go with the interface pattern that users are more familiar with.</p>
