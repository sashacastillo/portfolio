                <h2>Client</h2>
                <p>An urban academic library, serving 45,000+ students.</p>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>A first-year student who is using the library for the first time needs a quick and self-sufficient way to get started with the library research tools and resources so that she can succeed in her class assignment.</p>
                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p>I fixed issues with the existing design and came up with a new Help Feature on the homepage. The new design provides point-of-use help and allows new students get started using library research tools.</p>

              <p>Through Google Analytics tracking I found that a top task on the website is conducting research for courses. A past survey showed that novice users demonstrate confusion and need help learning how to use the library website research tools for the first time.</p>
              <p>The original help feature on the homepage consisted of a single "help tip". I focused on improving this feature and transforming it into a more robust set of on-boarding tools.</p>

              <h2>User Interface Patterns Research</h2>
              <p>During the process of creating the first two prototypes, I have researched existing UI patterns for on-boarding and help features on various websites and apps. The aim of this research was to use User Interface patterns that users are familiar with and re-use existing design ideas.</p>

              <p>I wanted to learn more about how students would react to two interfaces. I designed two interactive prototypes and did a guerrilla user testing with 25 students. The result was that students liked elements from both prototypes and I worked on incorporating both ideas in the next iteration.</p>

              <p>It was imperative that I seek staff help to learn about existing teaching practices and incorporate them into the design of the Library Help feature. I planned, designed, and conducted a focus group with staff. I received valuable feedback for the language to be used, staff preferences, and a "buy in" from a critical group of stakeholders.</p>

This alternative design became too long, and the students abandoned the interaction before reaching the end of it, so I did not use it.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual</strong> - students preferred a lot of images and short text</li>
                <li><strong>Concise</strong> - students were more likely to complete the task</li>

              <h2>Lessons Learned: Listening to Users and Project Management</h2>
              <p>I learned to listen to the user preferences even though they may be different from our own. For example, I preferred a more complex solution, however users wanted an easier set up which can help them get through the task faster. This project has also expanded my project management skills as I was able to practice creating project goals and roadmap, making sure I keep on track, and communicate with and gain approval from stakeholders.</p>
