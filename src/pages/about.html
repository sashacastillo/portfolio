            <h2>My Story</h2>

            <p>I am a passionate learner and communicator. Having pursued Graphic Design and Web Development, I have spent recent years expanding my knowledge to UX Design.</p>
            <p>I have a <a href="/work.html"><strong>growing portfolio</strong></a> that showcases an active involvement in all stages of a user-centered design process. My top UX/UI Design strengths are the ability to facilitate meaningful feedback, and to address user needs with functional and intuitive design.</p>
            <p>I have lived for over 10 years in the "Mountain States", where I enjoy hiking, reading, spending time with friends, and exploring new things I haven't done before.</p>
